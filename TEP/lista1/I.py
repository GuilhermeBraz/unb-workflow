"""Stan and Ollie play the game                                
of Odd Brownie Points. Some                                 
brownie points are located in the
plane, at integer coordinates. Stan
plays first and places a vertical
line in the plane. The line must
go through a brownie point and
may cross many (with the same x-
coordinate). Then Ollie places a
horizontal line that must cross a
brownie point already crossed by
the vertical line.
Those lines divide the plane
into four quadrants. The quad-
rant containing points with arbitrarily
large positive coordinates is
the top-right quadrant.
The players score according to the number of brownie points in the quadrants. If a brownie point is
crossed by a line, it doesnâ€™t count. Stan gets a point for each (uncrossed) brownie point in the top-right
and bottom-left quadrants. Ollie gets a point for each (uncrossed) brownie point in the top-left and
bottom-right quadrants.
Your task is to compute the scores of Stan and Ollie given the point through which they draw their
lines."""
